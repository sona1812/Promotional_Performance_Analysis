## Conclusion and Recommendations
* The Diwali season generates higher revenue compared to Sankranti, indicating that the company should focus more on promotions and offers during this period
* Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad have shown significant revenue growth; therefore, the company should consider expanding its presence by opening more stores in these cities
* Only the BOGOF and 500 Cashback promotion types led to significant revenue increases during both festival seasons, whereas the 50% OFF, 33% OFF, and 25% OFF promotions had a negative impact on revenue. 
  Therefore, the company should consider expanding the effective promotion types(BOGOF, 500 Cashback) while limiting or reevaluating the less effective ones.
* The promotion type analysis clearly indicates that customers are more attracted to free products and cashback offers because Offers like BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) feel like a bonus rather than a discount  
  they create excitement and perceived generosity.
* Cashback promotions give a sense of getting money back, which feels like a reward. Customers may even see it as a future discount or saving.It also encourages repeat purchases, especially if cashback is 
  credited to wallets or future use.
* Flat discounts (like 25%, 50% off) require customers to calculate savings, but free products or cashback are instant gratification â€” no math needed.
* Combo1 and Home Care categories show the highest increase in revenue, while the Personal Care category has a negative impact. This indicates that during festive seasons, customers prefer purchasing Home Care 
  and Combo products. Therefore, the company should focus on offering more promotions in these categories during such periods.
